# Ensure tpu_raiden is importable for BOTH supported install paths. Sourced by
# prefill.sh / decode.sh AFTER RAIDEN_ROOT is set and a venv is active.
#
#  - Wheel install (`pip install tpu-raiden-jax ...`): tpu_raiden is already
#    importable from site-packages (generated protos + the engine .so are bundled
#    inside the package), so we leave PYTHONPATH alone. Prepending the source tree
#    would SHADOW the installed package with a copy lacking the built .so/protos.
#  - Build-from-source (`./build.sh jax`): tpu_raiden is not installed, so expose
#    it from the repo: the root holds the `tpu_raiden` package, bazel-bin holds
#    the generated protobuf modules.
#
# The only remaining requirement is that `import tpu_raiden` works -- which
# is exactly what this file guarantees.
